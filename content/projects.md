**TOTS (Tiered Online Trainings and Supports):** Iterative development of an online training program for caregivers of young children with developmental delay. The program will provide a tiered model of supports, or matched to caregiver need. Currently, I am helping to qualitatively code information from stakeholder (parent, provider, young adult) input, to help inform our development. I also helped to lead a parent focus group. 

**Systematic Review of Web and Smartphone-Based Parent-Mediated Interventions:** I am currently the lead author on a systematic review of technology based parent trainings for parents of children with ASD. We presented this research in a poster session at INSAR 2019. We are currently in the process of writing a manuscript. You can find a copy of the poster on [research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth_Glenn4). 

**Kid Brain Network:** We are aquiring resting state fMRI scans of children with previous or current diagnoses of ASD or DD. I help children acclimate to the scanner during mock sessions, and provide behavioral support and safety monitoring during MRI scans. 

**Mindfulness + Incredible Years:** We are testing how the efficacy of the Incredible Years intervention changes when caregivers recieve mindfulness meditation support. For this project, I am coding parent-child interaction videos for strategies that are in alignment with intervention targets. 

**CogBites:** I am a contributing author to the blog [CogBites](https://cogbites.org), which aims to provide accessible knowledge about the mind in easy to read, bite size posts. You can read my posts [here](https://cogbites.org/author/epglenn2/).
