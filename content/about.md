title: ABOUT ME
---



I attended Furman University for my undergraduate, and graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology and Music. Following graduation, I worked as a resarch assistant on various projects under the supervision of Dr. Kimberly Carpenter and Dr. Geraldine Dawson at the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development in Durham, NC. My main involvement was with a project investigating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between sensory over-responsivity and anxiety in pre-schoolers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I also assisted with the processing of MRI, EEG, and EGT data, as well as an ongoing Autism Center of Excellence grant investigating the relationship between ASD and ADHD. 

In the fall of 2018, I began my graduate PhD studies in School Psychology at the University of Oregon. My supervisor is Laura Lee McIntyre. I also am involved with research with Dr. Nicole Guiliani. For more about my current projects click [here](/projects).   

My current research interests include: 

-The convergence of neurodevelopment and academic achievement, specifically in children with ASD, ADHD, and developmental delay

-The integration of community services and family involvement with schools

-The use of technology in expanding access to evidence-based caregiver supported child developement interventions
